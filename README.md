For the Machine Learning side of this project, we're inspired by this Batik pattern recognition [repository](https://github.com/yohanesgultom/deep-learning-batik-classification). We also use transfer learning method to get our model better. You can refer to this [medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-for-image-classification-using-tensorflow-71c359b56673) to learn about it.
